## finance/be-05: Refine TransactionParticipant and Exchange Models

- Subtasks:
  - ⌛ Use TDD approach; create the tests before.

          and no transaction_participant.
  - ⌛ When a transaction_participant is not a payer:
    - 1 ⌛ The transaction_participant should have `is_payer: false, status = 'finished'`.

## finance/be-06: Calculate transactions based on CardTransaction, Exchange and Investment
